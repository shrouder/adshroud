AdShroudâ„¢ is the Shrouder opt-in secure ad delivery project.

Everyone hates ads, so why an ad delivery project?  

The simple answer is economics- the need to keep the lights on and grow *for all the right reasons*.  

Unlike foundations such as Apache which focus on the delivery of software, Shrouder's mission is to provide hosted solutions that return the control of privacy to users in keeping with <a href="http://www.notrust.org">NoTrust</a> principles.

Megascale hosting is expensive, though.  To get a sense for the scale of hosting costs, even as early as 2010, Facebook was spending about $1 per user per month (the better part of its *$860 million* budget at the time) to deliver its solutions to users.  Bear in mind that Shrouder's goals are even more ambitious in terms of the variety of activities- from voice to microblogging to text messaging and email- that Shrouder is here to help users protect.  Unobtrusive ads are one way that Shrouder might hope to make its solutions available to users at no cost long-term- but never at the cost of user security.  Ad delivery that complies with <a href="http://www.notrust.org">NoTrust</a> principles means leveraging and building on efforts such as Google Caja to enable ad delivery that *verifiably* doesn't threaten browser security. 

We hope to find other ways to pay Shrouder's hosting bills wherever possible (sponsorships, donations, paid services to business, walking the beach for ambergris chunks- we're open to suggestions!), but in the end we have to have resources to grow and *securely* serve our users.
